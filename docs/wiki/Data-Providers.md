# Data providers

Provider selection is workflow- and instrument-specific; not every panel uses
the same fallback chain. Available history, entitlement, throttling and upstream
formats can all limit coverage. Keyless access is not an availability guarantee,
and knowing a provider does not establish price accuracy or historical vintage.

Generic equity workflows default to US/NASDAQ when no usable market is supplied.
Explicit India selections retain NSE/BSE, INR and their intended benchmarks.
EU/UK Yahoo suffixes such as `.L`, `.DE` and `.PA` bypass the India path.

## Markets and search

| Provider/source | Retained role | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Nasdaq Trader listings, pytickersymbols, CoinGecko | US, EU/UK and crypto instrument universe, with Yahoo long-tail search | Keyless paths; optional CoinGecko demo key |
| Yahoo Finance | Quotes, chart/history fallbacks and corporate actions; EU symbols retain exchange suffixes | No provider key; unofficial access may fail or throttle |
| FMP | Selected equity history, fundamentals, earnings, commodities and calendar paths | `FMP_API_KEY`; coverage depends on endpoint/plan |
| Finnhub | US live ticks and selected REST/calendar/candle fallbacks | `FINNHUB_API_KEY`; subscriptions and access are provider-dependent |
| CoinGecko | Crypto search, market/valuation/supply data and candle paths | Optional `COINGECKO_API_KEY` |
| Binance | Available public crypto spot streams and selected derivatives/depth data | `OPENTERMINALUI_BINANCE_WS_ENABLED` controls spot ticks |
| DefiLlama | Crypto usage context such as TVL and fees | Keyless |
| Zerodha Kite | Intentional India real-time/history/F&O workflows | `KITE_API_KEY`, `KITE_API_SECRET`, `KITE_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| Direct NSE website | Opt-in compatibility for selected India data | `OPENTERMINALUI_NSE_PUBLIC_ENABLED=1` |

Direct unauthenticated NSE requests are off by default. The first opted-in
HTTP 403 opens a process-level circuit; do not keep refreshing a blocked
session. Prefer configured Kite or applicable Yahoo `.NS`/`.BO` data.

The instrument universe auto-seeds and periodically refreshes according to
`OPENTERMINALUI_INSTRUMENT_AUTOSEED` and
`OPENTERMINALUI_INSTRUMENT_REFRESH_HOURS`. Sources refresh independently so a
failed source does not wipe existing listings. Search suggestions do not
guarantee a provider can supply usable chart history.

## Comparison fundamentals and macro evidence

| Source | Bounded comparison role | Configuration and limits |
|---|---|---|
| SEC EDGAR | Current Company Facts, submission metadata and v2.1 selected source-filing checks | `SEC_USER_AGENT` identifies app/operator and real contact email; exact ticker/CIK and selected concepts/forms only |
| FMP fundamentals | Source-dated current-feed candidates and explicit owner captures | `FMP_API_KEY`; not a complete revision archive |
| FRED | US reference-period observations and optional pair-end daily real-time checks | `FRED_API_KEY`; daily provider intervals are not intraday dissemination records |
| Eurostat | Selected current euro-area HICP/unemployment, first-published HICP and bounded unemployment archive checks | Keyless; archive gaps, flags and composition changes remain explicit |
| ECB | Selected euro-area deposit facility rate | Keyless; observation dates do not establish asset-specific causation |
| Finnhub/FMP calendar | Explicit requests for events in the pair window | Keys and usable provider coverage required; no sample substitution |

SEC requests are opt-in and process-locally paced, not a deployment-wide archive
crawler. A source-filing check reads the official filing index and listed XBRL
instance, with 2 MiB/12 MiB document limits, XML complexity limits and a 45-second
deadline. Corroboration requires exact company-wide concept, unit, fiscal
duration and value; an accession appearing in an index is insufficient.
[Research Workflows](Research-Workflows.md) explains the UI and API outcomes.

Macro context is global, not automatically selected for the ticker. A reference
month, filing date, acceptance timestamp and terminal retrieval time are
different evidence. None alone proves what an investor knew at a past time.
See [Limitations](Limitations.md) for precise panel coverage.

## FX valuation

Portfolio accounting resolves USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF, AUD, CAD and INR pairs from
Yahoo daily FX charts, trying the inverse pair when necessary. Configured
Finnhub/OANDA candles are the fallback. Dated valuation chooses the last close
on or before the requested date, accepting gaps up to seven days; historical
analytics batch required dates per pair. Missing conversion makes dependent
totals partial rather than assuming parity.

Comparison reporting-currency views are separate: they require supported quote
units and dated rates on the relevant endpoints or every original shared date
for a full path. They are not a replacement for portfolio ledger accounting.

## Caches and resilience

Chart caches reduce repeated provider calls. Some are SQLite sidecars even on a
PostgreSQL application deployment; Redis provides shared cache/quote distribution.
TTL, backoff, circuit breakers and explicit degradation must be preserved when
changing adapters. Do not cache provider 429/5xx responses as successful data.

Set `OPENTERMINALUI_PREFETCH_ENABLED=1` only when deliberate cache warming is
wanted. Quotas, delays, commercial terms and entitlement change by provider:
check the operator's actual plan rather than treating a hard-coded free-tier
quota or an old QC report as an SLA.

## Model providers and privacy

The shared client uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, defaulting to local Ollama.
Chat and embeddings must both be local to keep that inference on the operator's
infrastructure. Hosted configuration sends selected prompts/evidence to the
configured provider. Embeddings and synthesis have distinct capability/fallback
requirements; model unavailability is not permission to invent a result.

## Operator notes

Configure market/model credentials in the host environment, not browser
automation-key settings. Copy the [environment template](../../.env.example),
replace example credentials, and recreate/restart the backend as appropriate.

Kite access tokens expire regularly; renewing credentials is a host/operator
workflow, not a supplied autonomous broker integration. Never commit tokens,
contact secrets or `.env` contents. General provider acquisition, live economic
calendar reliability and paid US/EU Level-2 adapters remain unscheduled gaps.

For a new adapter, inspect the actual consumer and tests first: fallback
contracts differ across charting, comparisons, accounting and optional evidence.
Update [surface classification](Surface-Inventory.md), configuration docs and
generated API contracts when public behavior changes.
